Twitter Tweet RESTful web service
  The code is fully functional. The twitter client application is an example of how to call the twitter web service.
  IMPORTANT: In order to run the web service, get the 4 keys from twitter- https://apps.twitter.com/ and enter them in web.config file in the restful data which is the twitter web service.
